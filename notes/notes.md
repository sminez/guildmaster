Each class has the same stat types (+/-10):
- Attack
- Defence
- Honour
- Loyalty
- Cunning
- Bravery
- Intelligence

And the following counts:
- level (0-4)
- hp (1-5)
- gold (0-10 * level)

Each class also has several (3?) skills that they unlock as they are used in a run (randomised?).
Possibly a pool of general skills /traits as well.

The guild has a number of rooms /assets that can be added (either found, bought or "traded"
for by sacrificing a guild member: ie play a blacksmith to unlock the armoury. Same for
upgrading though some require items to unlock)

Start with the guikdmaster, a single room in a tavern and enough gold for one mission.
- missions are shirt/medium/long in terms of number of events (cards to deal with)
- completion gets a reward
- failure looses guild members and resources
- guild members should feel expendable

Should have lots of options and choices to increase replay with no/minimal metagame level persistence.
-> inherit the guild from a parent?
- the guild structure remains but guild members retire and things need repairing?
